## Introduction to Networking
Networking is basically about how computer and devices connect with each other to share data & resources.
For example, when your laptop connects to wi-fi, it's part of a network that lets it talk to other devices and the internet.


### Types of Network
There are 4 types of network which are below -

1. PAN(Personal Area Network) : Connects devices around one person, like mobile and laptop connectivity to earbuds.
2. LAN(Local Area Network) : Connects computers within a small area like home, school or all computer in office sharing a printer. 
3. MAN(Metropoliton Area Network) : Connects multiple LANs across a city or large campus.
4. WAN(Wide Area Network) : Connects networks across countries — like the Internet.


### Network Components

There are two main types of components in networking:

###  1. Hardware Components
These are the physical parts of a network, they help in connecting,sending and recieving data. like - Routers,Hub, Switches, Server, Firewall etc.

**Hardware is further divided into:**
- **End Devices** – These are the devices that people use to send or receive data. These are the source & destination points of communication. It is mainlyl used by users (like Computer, Laptop, Mobile)
- **Intermediary Devices** – It Connects and control data, they make sure the data goes to the right place (like Router, Switch, Hub)
- **Network Media** – This is the path that data uses to travel from one device to another. It can be wired (cables) or wireless (wi-fi signals)

###  2. Software Components
These are the programs & rules that control how the network works. we can't touch but they make the network work. like - IP Addressing, Protocols (like TCP/IP) etc.


### Network Topologies

It shows that how computers and devices are connected to each other in a network.
There are 4 types of topologies -

1. BUS Topology - All computers or devices are connected to single cable, Simple but prone to failure. Example - Old Ethernet networks 
   Pros - We can modify and extend cable easily.
   Cons - Until one device finishes sending data, others must wait. If two send together, their data can crash into each other.
2. RING Topology - Devices will connect in a circle, Devices from a circular connection & data will travel in one direction. Example - Metro Networks.
   Pros - data will sentin the form of Token.
   Cons - If one fails or down or cannot send the message then whole network  will down.
3. STAR Topology - All devices connect to one central device. Example - Most common in homes & Offices.
   Pros - We can send data from any node to any other node in the network.
   Cons - If central hub downs then whole  network will destroy.
4. MESH Topology - Every device is connected to every other device . so there will be multiple paths between devices. Example - Millitary communication Network.
   Pros - It always establish a connection between two nodes (point to point connection).
   Cons - It is difficult for installation & Configuration, It is expensive as well.

### Importance of Networking in IT 

Networkin is most important in the field of IT (Information Technology) because it helps devices & people connect, share, and communicate easily. like -
- Resource Sharing : Users can share files, printers, and internet without needing separate devices for everyone.
- Data Security - It helps in protecting & monitoring data safely using firewalls and servers.
- Cloud Computing - Networking gives access to the internet & cloud services like Google Drive, AWS or Azure.
