# Day 1
## Introduction to Networking
Networking is basically about how computer and devices connect with each other to share data & resources.
For example, when your laptop connects to wi-fi, it's part of a network that lets it talk to other devices and the internet.


### Types of Network
There are 4 types of network which are below -

1. PAN(Personal Area Network) : Connects devices around one person, like mobile and laptop connectivity to earbuds.
2. LAN(Local Area Network) : Connects computers within a small area like home, school or all computer in office sharing a printer. 
3. MAN(Metropoliton Area Network) : Connects multiple LANs across a city or large campus.
4. WAN(Wide Area Network) : Connects networks across countries — like the Internet.


### Network Components

There are two main types of components in networking:

###  1. Hardware Components
These are the physical parts of a network, they help in connecting,sending and recieving data. like - Routers,Hub, Switches, Server, Firewall etc.

**Hardware is further divided into:**
- **End Devices** – These are the devices that people use to send or receive data. These are the source & destination points of communication. It is mainlyl used by users (like Computer, Laptop, Mobile)
- **Intermediary Devices** – It Connects and control data, they make sure the data goes to the right place (like Router, Switch, Hub)
- **Network Media** – This is the path that data uses to travel from one device to another. It can be wired (cables) or wireless (wi-fi signals)

###  2. Software Components
These are the programs & rules that control how the network works. we can't touch but they make the network work. like - IP Addressing, Protocols (like TCP/IP) etc.


### Network Topologies

It shows that how computers and devices are connected to each other in a network.
There are 4 types of topologies -

1. BUS Topology - All computers or devices are connected to single cable, Simple but prone to failure. Example - Old Ethernet networks 
   Pros - We can modify and extend cable easily.
   Cons - Until one device finishes sending data, others must wait. If two send together, their data can crash into each other.
2. RING Topology - Devices will connect in a circle, Devices from a circular connection & data will travel in one direction. Example - Metro Networks.
   Pros - data will sentin the form of Token.
   Cons - If one fails or down or cannot send the message then whole network  will down.
3. STAR Topology - All devices connect to one central device. Example - Most common in homes & Offices.
   Pros - We can send data from any node to any other node in the network.
   Cons - If central hub downs then whole  network will destroy.
4. MESH Topology - Every device is connected to every other device . so there will be multiple paths between devices. Example - Millitary communication Network.
   Pros - It always establish a connection between two nodes (point to point connection).
   Cons - It is difficult for installation & Configuration, It is expensive as well.

### Importance of Networking in IT 

Networkin is most important in the field of IT (Information Technology) because it helps devices & people connect, share, and communicate easily. like -
- Resource Sharing : Users can share files, printers, and internet without needing separate devices for everyone.
- Data Security - It helps in protecting & monitoring data safely using firewalls and servers.
- Cloud Computing - Networking gives access to the internet & cloud services like Google Drive, AWS or Azure.

# Day 2
We learnt Types of Networking(LAN, MAN & WAN) in detail -

1. **LAN** :
   **Fullform** - Local Area Network
   **Distance** - 1-2km
   **Geographical Area** - Small area — like a home, school, or office.
   **High-Speed** - Its speed is very high appx. (100mbps- 10gbps)
   **Example** - Wi-Fi in our home, computers in a computer lab.
   **Use** - It is used for connecting computers & devices in one buiding.
    **Common Technologies** - LAN mostly uses Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi to connect nearby devices.

3. **MAN** :
   **Fullform** - Metropoliton Area Network
   **Distance** - 5-50km
   **Geographical Area** - Medium area — like a city or large campus.
   **High-Speed** - High (10mbps - 1gbps)
   **Example** - City-wide Internet, college campus network.
   **Use** - It is used for may LAN'S within one city.
   **Common Technologies** - MAN uses high-speed fiber or wireless links to connect networks across a city.

4. **WAN** :
   **Fullform** - Wide Area Network
   **Distance** - Unlimited
   **Geographical Area** - Large area — across countries or the whole world.
   **High-Speed** - It has lower or variable speed (1mbps - 100gbps)
   **Example** - The Internet, bank branch networks.
   **Use** - It is used for connecting many LAN's * MAN's together.
   **Common Technologies** - WAN connects countries or continents using satellite or long-distance Internet lines.


#### Let's Pratice with few questions -


Scenario: You are IT consultant for "EduTech Solutions" - an educational software company.

Company Details:
Main office: 100 employees in downtown building
Development center: 50 employees, 5 km away
Regional sales offices: 3 locations across the state
Remote workers: 25 employees working from home
Your Task:
Design a network architecture plan identifying:

What type of network for main office? (LAN/MAN/WAN) - **LAN**
How to connect development center? (LAN/MAN/WAN) - **MAN**
How to connect regional offices? (LAN/MAN/WAN) - **WAN**
How to support remote workers? (LAN/MAN/WAN) - **WAN**

# Day 3

On Day 3 we learnt about Network Addresses that are IP Address and Mac Address.
Firstly will know, **What is Network Addresses?** -- A network address is like an identity for each device or it is like a name or address for a device in a networkn that helps computers find each other and share data easily. There are 2 Types of addresses that are below -


 1. **MAC Address**
  -  A MAC address is a unique ID number given to every device that connects to a network. like      a computer, phone, or printer. It is fixed and cannot be changed because it is built into     -  the device when it is made.
    It has 12 characters made of numbers and letters, usually written with colons - 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
    - Its length has 48bits (6 bytes)
    

 2. **IP Address**
    - An IP Address is a unique number given to every device on a network, It helps devices find and talk to each other — like a home address helps people find your house.
    - There are 2 types of IP Address -
      1. IPv4: It has 32-bit address
         Example – 192.168.0.1
         It uses numbers with dots.

      3. IPv6: It has 128-bit address
         Example – 2001:0db8:85a3::7334
         It uses letters and numbers.
