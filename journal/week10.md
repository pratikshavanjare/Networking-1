# Firewall

A **firewall** is a security device or software that controls **incoming and outgoing network traffic**.  
It allows or blocks traffic based on **predefined security rules**.

## Why Firewalls Are Important
- Protect the network from hackers  
- Block unauthorized access  
- Allow only safe communication  
- Prevent viruses and attacks  
- Monitor network traffic

## How a Firewall Works (Simple)
A firewall works like a **security guard**:

1. Checks every network packet  
2. Compares it with firewall rules  
3. Allows safe packets  
4. Blocks suspicious packets

## Types of Firewalls

### 1. Packet Filtering Firewall
- Checks IP, port, and protocol  
- Simple and fast  

### 2. Stateful Firewall
- Tracks active connections  
- More secure than packet filtering  

### 3. Proxy Firewall
- Works as a middle-man  
- Hides the internal network  

### 4. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
- Deep packet inspection  
- Detects applications  
- Blocks advanced threats
