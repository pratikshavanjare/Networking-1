Scenario:

PC1 pings PC2. Answer the following questions based on the echo request message sent from PC1 to PC2.


1) What is the destination MAC address in the frame at A in the network?
   
   a) PC1's MAC address

   b) PC2's MAC address

   c) Switch1's G1/0/1 MAC address

   d) Switch2's G1/0/2 MAC address

   e) Router1's G0/0/0 MAC address

   f) Router1's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   g) Router2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   h) Router2's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   i) Switch2's G1/0/1 MAC address

   j) Switch2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   k) There is no MAC address

   Your Answer: The answer is "e" because when PC1 sends data to another network, so it first sends it to its router. That’s why the destination MAC is the  router’s interface (G0/0/0) connected to PC1.
   ```
   R1> en
   R1# sh run
   !
   !
   !
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
   mac-address 0010.aaaa.aaaa
   ip address 10.1.1.254 255.255.255.0
    ```



2) What is the destination MAC address at A in the network?
   
   Your Answer: mac-address 0010.aaaa.aaaa



3) What encapsulation is used at A in the network?

   Your Answer: Ethernet II (PC1 and Router1 are connected in a **LAN**, so they use **Ethernet** to send data)



4) What is the destination MAC address in the frame at C in the network?
   
   a) PC1's MAC address

   b) PC2's MAC address

   c) Switch1's G1/0/1 MAC address

   d) Switch2's G1/0/2 MAC address

   e) Router1's G0/0/0 MAC address

   f) Router1's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   g) Router2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   h) Router2's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   i) Switch2's G1/0/1 MAC address

   j) Switch 2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   k) There is no MAC address

   Your Answer: The answer is "k-There is no MAC address" 



5) What encapsulation is used at C in the network?

   Your Answer: HDLC because At point C, the connection is between Router1 and Router2 over a serial link,
and serial links use HDLC encapsulation to send data.



6) What is the destination MAC address in the frame at D in the network?
   
   a) PC1's MAC address

   b) PC2's MAC address

   c) Switch1's G1/0/1 MAC address

   d) Switch2's G1/0/2 MAC address

   e) Router1's G0/0/0 MAC address

   f) Router1's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   g) Router2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   h) Router2's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   i) Switch2's G1/0/1 MAC address

   j) Switch 2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   k) There is no MAC address

   Your Answer: b "PC2'S MAC address



7) What is the destination MAC address at D in the network?

   Your Answer: 0010.2222.2222
   In the network D the destination MAC address is PC2's MAC address , So if we run a command(ipconfig/all) on PC2 it will show--

8) What encapsulation is used at D in the network?

   Your Answer: Ethernet II



9) What is the destination MAC address in the frame at E in the network?
    
   a) PC1's MAC address

   b) PC2's MAC address

   c) Switch1's G1/0/1 MAC address

   d) Switch2's G1/0/2 MAC address

   e) Router1's G0/0/0 MAC address

   f) Router1's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   g) Router2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   h) Router2's Se0/1/0 MAC address

   i) Switch2's G1/0/1 MAC address

   j) Switch 2's G0/0/0 MAC address

   k) There is no MAC address

   Your Answer: b) PC2's MAC address



10) What is the destination MAC address at E in the network?

    Your Answer: The MAC address will be PC2'S MAC address which is 0010.2222.2222



11) What encapsulation is used at E in the network?

    Your Answer: Ethernet II
